## Append Contents

You can append contents to an existing index like:

```js
index.append(id, content);
```

This will not overwrite the old indexed contents as it will do when perform `index.update(id, content)`. Keep in mind that `index.add(id, content)` will also perform "update" under the hood when the id was already being indexed.

Appended contents will have their own context and also their own full `resolution`. Therefore, the relevance isn't being stacked but gets its own context.

Let us take this example:

```js
index.add(0, "some index");
index.append(0, "some appended content");

index.add(1, "some text");
index.append(1, "index appended content");
```

When you query `index.search("index")` then you will get index id 1 as the first entry in the result, because the context starts from zero for the appended data (isn't stacked to the old context) and here "index" is the first term.

If you didn't want this behavior than just use the standard `index.add(id, content)` and provide the full length of content.

## Update item from an index

> Index.**update(id, string)**

```js
index.update(0, "Max Miller");
```

## Remove item from an index

> Index.**remove(id)**

```js
index.remove(0);
```
